        The updated overview page of the Clotilde UI. 
        All logs are visualized as before. 
        The user can share or revoke access the users having access to a log by clicking on the corresponding button in the table.}

    \caption[Clotilde UI: Share and revoke access]{
        This view allows the user to share or revoke access to a log. 
        On the left-hand side the details of the log are displayed. 
        On the right-hand side the user can search for other users in the system. 
        If a user is found it can be added to the set of recipients. 
        Moreover, the access to certain users can be revoked by removing them from the list of recipients.}

    \caption[Clotilde Ui: Shared logs]{
        This view lists all logs which were shared with the logged-in users.
        It is realized as additional section within the menu.
