Security and privacy are among top concerns for the public cloud environments. Towards end-to-end content security, we propose and implement CloudSeal, a scheme for securely sharing and distributing content via the public cloud. CloudSeal ensures the confidentiality of content in the public cloud environments with flexible access control policies for subscribers and efficient content distribution via content delivery network.CloudSeal seamlessly integrates symmetric encryption, proxy-based re-encryption, k-out-of-n secret sharing, and broadcast revocation mechanisms. These algorithms allow CloudSeal to cache the major part of a stored cipher content object in the delivery network for content distribution, while keeping the minor part in the cloud storage for key management. The separation of subscription-based key management and confidentiality-oriented proxy-based re-encryption policies uniquely enables flexible and scalable deployment of the solution as well as strong security for cached content in the network. We have implemented CloudSeal on Amazon Web Services, including EC2, S3, and CloudFront. Through experimental evaluation, we demonstrate the end-to-end efficiency and scalability of CloudSeal.},

   key). We describe a new concept for fine-grained sharing of encrypted
   data that we call Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE). In ABE, ciphertexts
   are labeled with sets of attributes and private keys are associated with
   access structures that control which ciphertexts a user is able to
   decrypt. We demonstrate the applicability of ABE to sharing of audit-log
   information and broadcast encryption. We describe a construction that

   Identity-Based Encryption (HIBE).}},

The scheme assumes the existence of trusted key generation centers, whose sole purpose is to give each user a personalized smart card when he first joins the network. The information embedded in this card enables the user to sign and encrypt the messages he sends and to decrypt and verify the messages he receives in a totally independent way, regardless of the identity of the other party. Previously issued cards do not have to be updated when new users join the network, and the various centers do not have to coordinate their activities or even to keep a user list. The centers can be closed after all the cards are issued, and the network can continue to function in a completely decentralized way for an indefinite period.},

In this model, a certificate --- or, more generally, a signature --- acts not only as a certificate but also as a decryption key. To decrypt a message, a keyholder needs both its secret key and an up-to-date certificate from its CA (or a signature from an authorizer). Certificate-based encryption combines the best aspects of identity-based encryption (implicit certification) and public key encryption (no escrow). We demonstrate how certificate-based encryption can be used to construct an efficient PKI requiring less infrastructure than previous proposals, including Micali's Novomodo, Naor-Nissim and Aiello-Lodha-Ostrovsky.},

  abstract = {Most of the existing broadcast encryption schemes are constructed in either public key cryptosystem or identity-based cryptosystem. However, the overload of certificate management is heavy for public key cryptosystem while the key escrow problem is inherent in identity-based cryptosystem. Certificate-based cryptosystem provides a promising solution of designing more efficient and secure broadcast encryption schemes. Meanwhile, it is an important security property to protect the privacy of receivers, anonymity in many broadcast encryption application scenarios. Furthermore, in the broadcast encryption applications with a large number of computationally constrained users, it is critical to lower the computation cost, especially the decryption cost of the users. In this paper, we first introduce the notion of anonymous certificate-based broadcast encryption. Specifically, we formalize the definition and security model for anonymous certificate-based broadcast encryption. Then we construct an anonymous certificate-based broadcast encryption scheme with constant decryption cost. Compared with the existing anonymous multi-receiver certificate-based encryption scheme, the proposed scheme has advantage in the computation efficiency. Therefore, our scheme is more feasible for those broadcast encryption application scenarios where there are many receivers with limited computation ability. In the respect of security, the proposed scheme achieves anonymity and confidentiality against adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks simultaneously under standard assumption.},

  abstract = {Since 2013, a stream of disclosures has prompted reconsideration of surveillance law and policy. One of the most controversial principles, both in the United States and abroad, is that communications metadata receives substantially less protection than communications content. Several nations currently collect telephone metadata in bulk, including on their own citizens. In this paper, we attempt to shed light on the privacy properties of telephone metadata. Using a crowdsourcing methodology, we demonstrate that telephone metadata is densely interconnected, can trivially be reidentified, and can be used to draw sensitive inferences.},

Finding the right tradeoff between these two quality attributes is not an easy endeavor. In this paper, we introduce an original design model based on a novel usability inspection method. This new method, named Security Usability Symmetry (SUS), exploits automata machines theory and introduces the concept of an advanced Multifunction Teller Machine (MTM). We demonstrate, via case study, how to use this model during the design of secure, usable interactive systems.},
