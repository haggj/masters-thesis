# Multi-Party End-to-End Encryption for the Inverse Transparency Toolchain
This is the github repo containing the latex project of my master thesis.
In the context of the thesis, I designed and implemented an E2EE encryption module for the inverse transparency toolchain [[1]](#1).
Along with this thesis three fully compatible crypto libraries were developed. A detailed documentation about the libs can be found within [the thesis](thesis.pdf).

The source code of the libraries can be found here:

- Typescript library [ts-it-crypto](https://github.com/haggj/ts-it-crypto)

- Python library [py-it-crypto](https://github.com/haggj/py-it-crypto)

- Golang library [go-it-crypto](https://github.com/haggj/go-it-crypto)
